# vodafonefm-spotify
Set of scripts to scrape the vodafone.fm website and create neat Spotify playlists
Depends on spotipy, even if broken. Will fix this, some day.

NowPlaying.py
    When run continuously, will listen to the vodafone.fm feed and will add playing songs to a predefined playlist on spotify

MonthlyPlaylist.py
    Run once, fetch the top songs from the vodafone.fm playlist and create a spotify playlist with them
